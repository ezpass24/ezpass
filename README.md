## Milestone 3 (4/11/24)

Progress: In this milestone, we aimed to have a relatively solid, working program with all vital components completed. We added security questions, created pages for listing and editing passwords, developed a page for database edits by admins, fixed landing page styling, and added TestCafe for testing.

## Dev Notes
Overall, working on EZPass was very fun for us. We are definitely proud at the fluidity of the program with how easy it is to sign up then start managing passwords. Our most difficult task was creating test cases. Test cases would work fine on our local machines but not on Github. This caused us to use tedious methods to solve it. We are a bit disappointed that we couldn't add more features in time (ex. login recovery).
